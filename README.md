# Auto-Soundboard

A soundboard is usually used for fun to either playback popular quotes from celebrities or characters. The idea behind Auto Soundboard is to feed in any audio file and have a word bank created with audio clips trimmed for each word recognized in the audio file. The user can then use Text to Speech to generate sentences using the speaker's real voice. The audio will probably sound mangled and not continuous, but it is a start.

Content creators that enjoy clipping audio snippets from speeches or videos will be able to take advantage of this to find word occurrences in audio files with audio clips of the word.

Django web application back-end to be created to allow easy user interaction with the audio transcription.
